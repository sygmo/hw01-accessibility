## Summary:

The goal of this assignment was to take an existing code base and rework the HTML and CSS to make it more accessible. The code was also refactored to make it more easily readable for other developers.

## Development:

The following tasks were completed:

- Alt descriptions were added to all images*
- Div elements were changed to more semantic elements (header, footer, main, aside, etc...)
- Header in footer changed to an h4 so that headers would follow a more logical order
- Comments were added to complicated segments of CSS code
- CSS code was refactored to reduce redundancy

*One exception is a background image defined in the CSS styles. There does not seem to be consensus on how such images should be labelled, and the image itself does not impart any important information. One possible solution would be to define the image in the html instead.
